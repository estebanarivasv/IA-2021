Do I really need M1 Pro for $2k?

Won't M1 do it for me if what I do is

• Connecting it to an external 4K Monitor anyway
• @Webflow and @figmadesign for the most-intensive tasks?
• At best, screen recording 4K"

For the same price as my 2019 MacBook Pro (2.4 Ghz 8-core, Pro Vega 16 4Gb, 32Gb RAM, 1Tb SSD), 
you can get the 16” M1Max with 64Gb RAM and 1Tb storage and still have +120€ to spare.
